.Sh NAME
.Nm checkrestart
.Nd check for processes that may need restarting
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl bHw
.Op Ar pid ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command attempts to find processes that need restarting following a software
upgrade, as indicated by their underlying executable or shared libraries no
longer appearing on disk.
.Pp
.Nm
does not perform any system changes itself \(em it is strictly informational and
best-effort (See the
.Sx BUGS
section).
It is the responsibility of the system administrator to interpret the results
and take any necessary action.
.Pp
For full system-wide checks,
.Nm
should be executed as the superuser to allow it access to global virtual memory
mappings.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl b
Check only for missing binaries, skipping the far more expensive check for stale
libraries.
.It Fl H
Suppress the header.
.It Fl w
Print the full width of the COMMAND column even if it will wrap in the terminal.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bd -literal -offset indent

.Pp
This output indicates
.Nm weechat
is using an out of date library, a
.Nm tmux
client/server pair is using an out-of-date executable, having replaced its
arguments list obscuring its location, and
.Nm memcached ,
running in Jail 1, is also out of date having left its arguments list as the
full path to its original executable.

.Sh HISTORY
A
.Nm
command first appeared in the debian-extras package in Debian Linux.
.Pp
This
.Nm
implementation performs a similar, but not identical task, and takes the name
because why not.
It is based on a similar implementation in the author's previous
.Nm pkg-cruft
Ruby script.

.Sh BUGS
.Nm
may report both false positives and false negatives, depending on program and
kernel behaviour, and should be considered strictly "best-effort".
.Pp
It is not currently possible to report what files are missing due to limitations
of the underlying interfaces.
